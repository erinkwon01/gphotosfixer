# GPhotos Fixer

Script written by Erin Kwon and Siddharth Nandy.

One alum who was sad about their Google Photos Google Takeout files being disorganized due to it being organized by Date Modified (which was set as the date we exported using Google Takeout). And another alum whom she paged for help. Our simple solution~

This creates a new folder and doesn't touch your original folders. Feel free to modify as needed if you want the changes to change in place. 

## Usage

Run `python3 gphotosfixer.py [input folder] [output folder]`.

## Next Steps

Next steps are to retrieve the metadata from the image/video itself and not the associated json file.
